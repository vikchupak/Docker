# Docker-in-Docker (DinD)

**Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** refers to the ability to run Docker containers **inside a Docker container**. In simple terms, it allows a **Docker container** to launch and manage **other Docker containers**. This is useful for CI/CD environments, like **Jenkins**, where you need to run Docker commands (build, push, run containers) inside a Jenkins pipeline or job.

---

### **Why Use Docker-in-Docker?**

**Building Docker Images Inside a CI/CD Pipeline is commonly used for the following**:
   - If you're running Jenkins (or other CI tools) inside a Docker container, you may need to build Docker images as part of your build process. DinD allows you to do this by enabling Docker commands within the Jenkins container itself.

### **How Does Docker-in-Docker Work?**

Docker uses a **Docker daemon** to manage containers. In DinD, the **Docker daemon** is running inside a container, and this container has access to **Docker commands**. There are two main ways to implement Docker-in-Docker:

1. **Privileged Mode. True Docker-in-Docker**:
   - The **`--privileged`** flag gives the container full access to the host system's kernel and allows it to run Docker inside Docker.
   - This is the **default and most common method** to enable Docker-in-Docker because it gives the container sufficient privileges to create and manage Docker containers.
   
2. **Docker Socket Binding/Mount. NOT true Docker-in-Docker**:
   - Instead of running Docker inside a container, you can **bind mount the Docker socket** from the host into the container. This method **does not require privileged mode** and provides the container access to the host's Docker daemon, allowing you to run Docker commands on the host system directly.
   - **Pros**: Safer and less resource-heavy.
   - **Cons**: The container can still affect the host system (if not properly isolated).

## `Mounting Docker Socket` is really considered Docker-in-docker?

Mounting the Docker socket is not the same as Docker-in-Docker (DinD), though both involve Docker inside a Docker environment.

- **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** involves running a full **Docker daemon inside a container**. This allows the container to launch its own containers, effectively running Docker within Docker. This is typically done with the --privileged flag or running Docker as a service inside the container.

- **Mounting the Docker socket** means giving the Jenkins container access to the hostâ€™s existing Docker daemon by linking the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) from the host to the container. Instead of running a Docker daemon inside the Jenkins container, the Jenkins container communicates directly with the Docker daemon running on the host machine.

In summary:

- Docker-in-Docker can be considered **true** "Docker in Docker" because you're running Docker from inside a container.
- Mounting the Docker socket **isn't truly "Docker-in-Docker,"** because you're not running Docker inside the containerâ€”you're simply giving the container access to the host's Docker daemon.

### **Using Docker-in-Docker with Jenkins**

When running **Jenkins in Docker**, you may need Docker-in-Docker to build Docker images, run containers, or interact with Docker-based resources inside your pipeline jobs. You have two main ways to set this up:

---

### **1. Docker-in-Docker with the `--privileged` Flag**

To allow Jenkins (or any Docker container) to run Docker inside Docker, use the **`--privileged`** flag when running the container. Here's how to set it up:

#### **a) Dockerfile for Jenkins with DinD**:

```Dockerfile
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts

# Switch to root to install Docker
USER root

# Install Docker
RUN curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash - && \
    apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Add Jenkins user to docker group to allow Docker commands
RUN usermod -aG docker jenkins

# Switch back to Jenkins user
USER jenkins

# Expose Jenkins ports
EXPOSE 8080 50000

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/tini", "--", "/usr/local/bin/jenkins.sh"]
```

#### **b) Running Jenkins with Docker-in-Docker**

To enable Docker-in-Docker, run the Jenkins container with the `--privileged` flag:

```bash
docker run --privileged -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
    --name jenkins custom-jenkins-with-dind
```

This will allow Jenkins running inside this container to execute Docker commands.

---

### **2. Docker-in-Docker with Docker Socket Binding**

Another way to achieve DinD is to **mount the Docker socket** from the host machine into the container. This method is safer and does not require the `--privileged` flag.

#### **a) Run Jenkins with Docker Socket Mounting**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

This allows the Jenkins container to use the hostâ€™s Docker daemon directly, which means Jenkins can run Docker commands without needing a Docker daemon inside the container itself.

#### **b) Running a Jenkins Pipeline with Docker Commands**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:16'  // Using a Node.js container to run your build
            args '-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' // Mount the Docker socket
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                // Run Docker commands inside the pipeline
                sh 'docker build -t my-app-image .'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This allows you to build Docker images from within Jenkins without running Docker inside the Jenkins container itself.

---

### **Pros and Cons of Docker-in-Docker (DinD)**

#### **Pros:**
- **Full isolation**: Each build can run in its own Docker container with a fresh environment.
- **Ease of integration**: If you're already using Docker in your development and deployment workflows, Docker-in-Docker integrates well with CI/CD systems like Jenkins.
- **Build Docker images inside containers**: Directly use Docker commands (like `docker build`) inside the Jenkins job, which is crucial for microservices-based workflows.

#### **Cons:**
- **Security risks**: Using the `--privileged` flag gives the container root access to the host system, which can be a security risk if not managed properly.
- **Resource overhead**: Running Docker inside Docker consumes more system resources, as you're managing an additional layer of virtualization.
- **Complexity**: Docker-in-Docker introduces additional complexity, as you're essentially running a Docker environment within another Docker environment.

---

### **When to Use Docker-in-Docker?**

1. **Building and testing Docker images** in Jenkins pipelines.
2. **Running isolated containers** (e.g., temporary test environments) within Jenkins.
3. **Using Docker commands** to manipulate containers inside Jenkins jobs (e.g., building, pushing, or running containers).

---

### **Alternatives to Docker-in-Docker**
If Docker-in-Docker feels overkill or youâ€™re concerned about security, consider these alternatives:

1. **Mount the Docker socket** (as mentioned above) â€” this is often preferred for security.
2. **Use Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to define your multi-container setups, which Jenkins can control via the host Docker daemon.
3. **Use Kubernetes**: For highly scalable setups, using **Kubernetes** with Jenkins allows you to manage containers dynamically in a more secure way without using Docker-in-Docker.

---

### **Conclusion**
Docker-in-Docker (DinD) is an incredibly useful tool for CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins when you need to **run Docker containers inside Jenkins jobs**, **build Docker images**, or **test containerized environments**. It can be enabled using the `--privileged` flag or by mounting the Docker socket. However, be mindful of security and resource usage.

# Using Docker Compose with Jenkins (still uses Host Docker Socket Binding)

**Docker Compose** is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Using **Docker Compose** in conjunction with **Jenkins** allows you to define complex environments (e.g., databases, web servers, etc.) for testing and building within your **CI/CD pipeline**. Jenkins can manage these containers through the host's Docker daemon, simplifying orchestration without needing to use **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)**.

---

### **Why Use Docker Compose with Jenkins?**

1. **Multi-Container Environments**:
   - Many applications require multiple containers (e.g., one for the web app, one for a database). With Docker Compose, you can define these multi-container environments in a single `docker-compose.yml` file.
   
2. **Easier Environment Setup**:
   - Docker Compose helps you manage **dependencies** and **configuration** for all the containers required in your CI/CD pipeline (like databases, caches, etc.).
   
3. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Jenkins interacts with Docker Compose using the host machine's Docker daemon, eliminating the need for Docker-in-Docker (DinD) and avoiding the associated complexity and security risks.

---

### **Basic Setup of Docker Compose with Jenkins**

To integrate Docker Compose with Jenkins, you'll define the services your application needs in a `docker-compose.yml` file and configure Jenkins to run and manage these containers.

#### **1. Install Docker Compose**

First, ensure **Docker Compose** is installed on the Jenkins host machine:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version  # Verify installation
```

#### **2. Define Multi-Container Setup Using Docker Compose**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the containers needed for your Jenkins pipeline. For example, let's say you need a **Node.js application**, a **MongoDB database**, and a **Redis cache**:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: node:14
    container_name: app
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    command: bash -c "npm install && npm start"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
      - redis

  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    container_name: redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

In this example:
- The **`app`** container runs a Node.js application.
- The **`mongo`** container runs MongoDB.
- The **`redis`** container runs Redis.

This setup allows the **Node.js app** to connect to **MongoDB** and **Redis**.

#### **3. Run Docker Compose in a Jenkins Pipeline**

Now, let's set up Jenkins to use Docker Compose in a pipeline. The key is to use the **host's Docker daemon** to control the containers.

##### **Jenkinsfile Example**:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME = 'myproject' // Project name for Compose
    }

    stages {
        stage('Setup Docker Compose') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Ensure Docker Compose is installed on the Jenkins agent
                    sh 'docker-compose --version'
                    
                    // Pull and start the containers
                    sh 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run your tests, for example:
                    sh 'docker exec app npm test'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Tear Down') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Clean up containers after the build
                    sh 'docker-compose down'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this pipeline:
- **`docker-compose up -d`** starts the containers in the background.
- **`docker exec`** allows you to run commands inside the containers (e.g., running tests inside the `app` container).
- **`docker-compose down`** stops and removes the containers once the job is done.

#### **4. Ensure Jenkins Has Docker Permissions**

For Jenkins to interact with Docker on the host, it needs to have access to Docker. This is done by mounting the Docker socket into the Jenkins container, so Jenkins can use the host's Docker daemon.

##### **Run Jenkins with Docker Socket Binding**:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

This binds the Docker socket from the host machine (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into the Jenkins container, allowing Jenkins to control Docker on the host.

---

### **5. Advanced Usage: Managing Multiple Environments**

With Docker Compose, you can easily extend this setup to handle different environments, such as **staging** and **production**. You can use multiple `docker-compose.yml` files or override configurations using the `-f` flag.

For example:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This allows you to maintain separate configurations for different environments, while still using the same Jenkins pipeline to manage deployments.

---

### **6. Benefits of Using Docker Compose in Jenkins**

- **Simplified Multi-Container Management**: With Docker Compose, you can define all required services (e.g., databases, caches, web servers) in a single configuration file. Jenkins can then orchestrate these services for your pipeline.
  
- **Consistency Across Environments**: Docker Compose ensures that the environment you build and test in locally matches the one in your CI/CD pipeline.

- **Isolation and Flexibility**: With Docker Compose, each service is isolated in its own container, which ensures that dependencies and configurations do not conflict with other jobs or environments.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Docker Compose** simplifies the management of multi-container environments in Jenkins by letting you define the entire infrastructure in a single file and control it with simple commands in your pipeline. It avoids the complexity of Docker-in-Docker (DinD) and allows Jenkins to seamlessly manage Docker containers with minimal overhead.


# Mount docker runtime from the Host to a container
```bash
# Mount docker.sock to allow the Jenkins instance inside the container to communicate with Docker on the host machine
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

```bash
# Inside contailer
# 1. Set correct permissions on docker.sock file
chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
# 2. Install docker CLI to enable you to run commands like docker build from within Jenkins
curl https://get.docker.com/ > dockerinstall && chmode 777 && ./dockerinstall
```

When you run `curl https://get.docker.com/ > dockerinstall && chmod 777 dockerinstall && ./dockerinstall` inside the Jenkins container, youâ€™re actually installing the **Docker Engine**, which includes both the Docker **CLI** (client) and the **Daemon**. However, only the CLI is relevant and functional in this context because:

1. **The Docker Daemon in the Container Won't Start**: The container doesnâ€™t have direct access to the low-level system resources required to run a second Docker daemon. Instead, it relies on the Docker daemon already running on the host, accessed via the socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`.

2. **Communication with Host Docker Daemon**: Mounting the Docker socket from the host (`/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) enables the Docker CLI inside the container to send commands to the Docker daemon on the host machine. The host's Docker daemon then handles container management based on these commands.

So, while the installation script technically installs both the Docker CLI and Docker daemon binaries, only the CLI is used. The Jenkins container essentially becomes a "client" that communicates with the Docker "server" (daemon) on the host, allowing it to run Docker commands without needing its own daemon.
